## 🏆 Featured Capstone Projects

### 🥇 [Secure User Authentication Suite (C#)](https://github.com/Tina-YingWang-AU/Secure-Auth-System-CSharp)
*My primary security-focused achievement for Certificate IV.*
This system implements a security-first architecture featuring **Dictionary-based data management**, case-insensitive verification, and automated **account lockout logic** to prevent brute-force attacks.

### 🥇 [Interactive Country Capital Quiz Engine (C#)](https://github.com/Tina-YingWang-AU/Country-Capital-Quiz-CSharp)
*Advanced Logic & Data Handling project for Certificate IV.*
Demonstrates high-level logic flow using **2D Array manipulation** and real-time state tracking. Engineered with a "crash-proof" mindset through comprehensive input sanitization and defensive programming.

### 🥇 [Gelos Enterprises: User Authentication & Security System (Python)](https://github.com/Tina-YingWang-AU/User-Auth-System-Python)
*The Capstone project for Certificate III.*
A professional-grade identity management solution designed for business frameworks. Features secure **File I/O persistence**, modular architecture, and robust input validation.
