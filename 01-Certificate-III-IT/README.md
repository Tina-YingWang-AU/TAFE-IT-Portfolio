# Certificate III in Information Technology - Technical Lab

This directory serves as a comprehensive archive of my technical work during the **ICT30120** qualification at TAFE NSW. It documents my progression from basic logic to structured Python programming.

---

## 🏆 Capstone Project (Featured)
*This is the major project for this qualification, showcasing advanced integration of Python skills.*

* **[Gelos Enterprises: User Authentication System](https://github.com/Tina-YingWang-AU/User-Auth-System-Python)**
    * *Core Focus:* Security-conscious identity management, data persistence, and modular coding.
    * *Key Skill:* Implementation of complex business logic and robust data validation.

---

## 🚀 Mini-Projects
*Structured assignments that solve specific functional requirements.*

* **[Marks Average Calculator](./Mini-Projects/marks-average-calculator/)**
    * *Core Focus:* User input validation and mathematical logic.
    * *Key Feature:* Handles out-of-range and non-integer inputs to prevent program crashes.

## 📗 Learning Track: Advanced Python Logic
A curated collection of lab exercises demonstrating my progression from core syntax to complex algorithmic thinking:

### 🧩 [01. Logic Challenges: Quiz Engine Evolution](./01-Logic-Challenges/)
* **Concepts:** Random sampling, state management, and code refactoring.
* **Outcome:** Demonstrates three distinct architectural approaches (Linear, Tracking, and Destructive) to managing dynamic datasets. Optimized for both memory efficiency and execution speed.



### 📐 [02. Software Design & Blueprinting](./02-Software-Design-and-Development/)
* **Focus**: The software development life cycle (SDLC) and documentation.
* **Key Outcome**: Created comprehensive pseudocode and system flowcharts (located in `design_docs`) to plan complex authentication logic before writing a single line of code.



### 🧮 [03. Algorithm Exploration: Manual Sorting](./03-Algorithm-Exploration/)
* **Concepts:** Computational complexity, in-place swapping, and File I/O.
* **Outcome:** A from-scratch implementation of the **Bubble Sort** algorithm. This project proves a deep understanding of how data is manipulated at a foundational level without relying on high-level built-in methods.
