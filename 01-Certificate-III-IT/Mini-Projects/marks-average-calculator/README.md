# Marks Average Calculator (Academic Performance Tool)

## 📝 Project Overview
This mini-project was developed to solve a common academic task: automating the calculation of student performance metrics. It provides a terminal-based interface that captures subject marks, performs real-time data validation, and outputs statistical summaries.

## 🛠️ Key Engineering Features
* **Defensive Programming:** Implemented robust input validation to ensure the system only processes integers between 0-100. The program is designed to catch `TypeErrors` and `ValueErrors` before they can cause a crash.
* **Dynamic Data Storage:** Utilizes Python Lists to dynamically store and manage input data, allowing for scalable calculations.
* **Professional Output:** Uses Python f-strings for precise and readable reporting of the sum and average results.
* **User Experience (UX):** Includes a clear command-line interface with visual separators (`=`) and instructional prompts.

## 💻 Technical Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Environment:** JetBrains PyCharm
* **Concepts:** `While` loops, `List.append()`, `String.isdigit()`, `Conditional Logic`.

## 📖 What I Learnt
Through this project, I mastered the art of **Input Sanitization**—understanding that a developer must never trust user input. I also practiced refactoring code to improve readability and PEP 8 compliance.
