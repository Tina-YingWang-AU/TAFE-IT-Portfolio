# 🧩 Python Logic Challenges

This folder contains selected programming challenges that demonstrate my ability to handle complex conditional logic, randomization, and user input validation.

### 🌍 Featured: Country-Capital Quiz Engine
This script is more than a simple quiz; it implements a robust game loop with the following technical features:

* **Non-Repeating Randomization**: Uses a tracking list to ensure every country in the dataset is presented exactly once per round.
* **Input Sanitization**: Implements nested `while` loops to force valid user responses (`y/n`), ensuring the program is resilient to unexpected user input.
* **State Management**: Handles game-over states and session resets, allowing the user to restart the game without re-running the script.

**Technical Tags:** `Randomization`, `List Manipulation`, `Nested Loops`, `Input Validation`.
